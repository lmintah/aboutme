        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is Laurence E. Mintah and I've been programming for over a year now. Creating apps, websites, and little games has been very fun and rewarding. When I found out that there are people who have actual jobs doing what I felt was just a hobby, I was filled with glee. Ever since then, I decided to bet on myself and pursue a career in web development. I have confidence that I am ready to begin, and I can't wait to see where this journey will take me.</p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p class="code-skill">I wish more people knew how fun programming could be. Although it can be quite challenging at first, it is not impossible to learn it. While I am not an expert, I have made a few interesting things such as a tip calculator using JavaScript, a, HTML5 game using JavaScript, and a few landing pages for fictional startups. I've enjoyed every second of it and can't wait to learn more! </p>

          <h3>Playing Piano</h3>
          <p class="piano-skill">I've been playing the piano consistently since I was in the 7th grade. I remember when I first got interested in it, my computer teacher was playing a song in the main hall. I approached him and asked if he could teach me, so he taught me every once in a while over the course of a month, then gave me a very important book called "Piano for Dummies". I was pretty offended at first but was so happy when I began reading it. I learned so much and even though I lost the book, the lessons I learned stuck with me up until now. </p>
